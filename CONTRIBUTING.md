## Search for Duplicates

Search the existing issues before logging a new one.

Some search tips:

* Don't restrict your search to only open issues. An issue with a title similar to yours may have been closed as a duplicate of one with a less-findable title.
* Check for synonyms. For example, if your bug involves an interface, it likely also occurs with type aliases or classes.
* Search for the title of the issue you're about to log. This sounds obvious but 80% of the time this is sufficient to find a duplicate when one exists.
* Read more than the first page of results. Many bugs here use the same words so relevancy sorting is not particularly strong.

## Did you find a bug?

When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:

* What version of TypeScript you're using (run tsc --v)
* If at all possible, an isolated way to reproduce the behavior
* The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior
